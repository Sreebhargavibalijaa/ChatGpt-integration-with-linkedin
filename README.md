# ChatGpt-integration-with-linkedin

Initially I tried getting feed posts on my profile considering count of posts as limit and passed the feed post content and comments as a prompt to the chatGpt Api to get the summary of my posts and comments. 
For this to be done, I have performed both linked and chatGpt Rest API calls.
Later from on the chatGpt API's summarized text, i am trying to segregate the posts based on the keywords present in the summary
Here is what I have worked on for the past couple of days,

Next steps:- building a website on top of it better user experience.
